In real-time and safety-critical systems, the move towards multi-cores is becoming unavoidable to satisfy the increasing processing requirements while maintaining a reasonable power consumption. A common trend in real-time safety-critical embedded systems is to integrate multiple applications on a single platform. Such systems are known as mixed-criticality systems as the applications are usually characterized by different criticality levels. However, multi-core systems are mainly designed to increase average performance, whereas embedded systems, and in particular mixed-criticality system, have additional requirements on safety, reliability and real-time behavior. Therefore, the shift to multi-cores raises several challenges. These architectures are challenging for safety-critical applications because they are in general not predictable. The difficulties increase when the multi-core hosts several applications and in particular mixed-critical applications.
\par  Mixed-criticality embedded systems are gaining considerable interest, but there is a lack of model-based tools for their development. This thesis proposes a model-based approach to handle the design complexity with the support of optimization techniques and code generation methods.
